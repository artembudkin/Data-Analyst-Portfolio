# Data Analyst Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio page, my name is Artem Budkin.


I am a recent graduate from the University of Technology Sydney. I love to discover and learn how things work, and the best way to learn it is to try it. This drives me to experiment and learn new things by creating projects. That is why this portfolio is just like my data knowledge, constantly evolving and expanding. As I tackle new data challenges, their result gets documented in this portfolio to demonstrate my knowledge and skills gained.  

# About me

Since a very young age, I always enjoyed solving puzzles and engineering things. Back in school, I started learning Python programming language and one of the first projects that I developed, was an algorithm to cipher and decipher texts using Vigen√®re cipher.
My passion led me to choose Forensic Science, majoring in Digital Forensics at the University of Technology Sydney. During my study, I was introduced to data analysis from the perspective of forensic science. I sharpened my Excel and Python skills  as well as learned how to utilize machine learning techniques for forensic data analysis. This gave me a solid foundation in data analysis that I further developed.

## Professional career

In my current role as Assistant Operations Manager at Merivale, I manage our digital ordering platform and point-of-sales system. Through my time in this role, I learned how to utilize the data generated by both systems to make data-driven decisions that make a direct impact on the business. As a part of my responsibilities, I collect, analyze, and present data-driven insights to relevant stakeholders. Based on these insights, I make informative actions that directly impact the business performance. These actions have resulted in a 50% increase in sales on our digital ordering platform and an increase in product upsells through various categories by 10%. Additionally, I proactively develop new data visualizations to provide our venue with unique perspectives on sales data. Collaborating closely with business stakeholders, I continuously improve the visualizations based on their feedback and needs. 

# Projects
### Global retailer sales analysis in Power BI
**Aim:** To derive key business performance indicators based on the sales history and create appealing visualizations highlighting relevant information for business management.  
  
**Detailed guide:** [Power BI Visualizations project](https://github.com/artembudkin/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Power%20BI%20Data%20Visualization%20Project/README.md)  
  
**Summary:** The company Plant Co. is a hypothetical global plant retailer. The company would like to utilize its data to create a clear dashboard highlighting the business performance for the management team. It provided an Excel workbook containing three datasets. Two of them contained dimensions tables: a customer accounts table and a products table, and one fact table containing sales data.   
As a part of this project, the following skills have been used: 
* Data cleaning  
* Key performance indicators calculation   
* DAX functions  
* Data visualization  
  
**Result:**  The final result is a dashboard containing key performance indicators, and slicers that allow filtering of data by year, gross revenue, quantity of units sold, and sales. The dashboard contains several visualizations comprised of a treemap, waterfall graph, stacked bar chart, and scatter plot highlighting the business performance relative to the previous year to date. The waterfall graph and stacked bar chart allow end-users to drill down to more detailed information based on time to identify performance drivers for those sections.

### Coffee sales data exploration in Excel  
**Aim:** To understand sales distribution based on the product category over time. Identify the general distribution of the sales based on the country and identify the top 5 most contributed customers to those sales.  
  
**Detailed guide:** [NBA Python Project](https://github.com/artembudkin/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/NBA%20Python%20Project/NBA_Data_Project.ipynb)   
  
**Summary:** The discovered Excel workbook contains a table with NBA seasons and NBA player that played during those seasons. Player's statistics involve physical attributes as well as regular season statistics, like average number of points scored. The dataset only contains records of players between 1997 and 2022 seasons
As a part of this project, the following skills have been used:
* Pandas    
* Matploitlyb  
* Seaborn
* Numphy
* Datetime  

**Result:** As a result of this analysis, I was able to highlight how the average NBA player has evolved due to change in NBA philosophy and style of play. The analysis highlights the change in trends towards more dynamic gameplay and more shooter dominant, rather than centre, which was the case in early 2000s. Also, due to NBA's expansion to a global market, the number of international players have been gradually increasing and now nearly 30% of all the NBA players were born not in USA.  

Furthermore, I had a look at the key features of the best performances during regular season. The analysis demonstrates how the best of the best players in the world were able to achieve their results as well as highlights some of most incredible performances in various categories.

### NBA data analysis in Python  
**Aim:**  
To understand the change in NBA players over the years.  
To explore and identify the key features of the best performances during regular season across three main categories: points, rebounds, assists.  
  
**Detailed guide:** [ Project](https://github.com/artembudkin/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Excel%20PivotTable%20Project/README.md)  
  
**Summary:** The provided Excel workbook contains the sales data of the mid-sized online coffee retailer. The coffee is sold across three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland. The business sells four different types of coffee, with various types of roast and in several sizes. The sales dataset only contains Order ID, Order Date, Customer ID, Product ID, and Quantity measures, the dimensional data is located in customers and products datasets.  
As a part of this project, the following skills have been used:
* XLOOKUP, MATCH, and INDEX functions  
* PivotTable and PivotChart  
* Data visualization

**Result:** The final result contains several PivotCharts organised by PivotTables formatted into a dynamic dashboard. This dashboard provides a view of the general distribution of sales based on the product category over time, based on country, and highlights the top 5 most contributed customers to those sales. Several slicers are present on the dashboard that allow end users to filter this data based on time, the type of the product, and whether the customer had a loyalty card at the time of the purchase.
