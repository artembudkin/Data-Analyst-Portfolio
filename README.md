# Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio page, my name is Artem Budkin.

I am an aspiring data analyst eager to learn something new every day. I love to discover and learn how things work, and the best way to learn it is to try it. This drives me to experiment and learn new things by creating projects. That is why this portfolio is just like my data knowledge, constantly evolving and expanding. As I tackle new data challenges, their result gets documented in this portfolio to demonstrate my knowledge and skills gained.

# About me

Since a very young age, I always enjoyed solving puzzles and engineer things. Back in school, I started learning Python programming language and one of the first projects that I created, was an algorithm to cipher and decipher using Vigen√®re cipher.
My passion led me to pick Forensic Science, majoring in Digital Forensics at the University of Technology Sydney. During my study, I was introduced to data analysis from the perspective of forensic science. From there I sharpened my existing Excel and Python skills  as well as learned how to utilize machine learning techniques for forensic data analysis. This provided me with a great data analytical foundation that I could expand on.
