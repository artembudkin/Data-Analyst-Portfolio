# Data Analyst Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio page, my name is Artem Budkin.


I am a recent graduate from the University of Technology Sydney. I love to discover and learn how things work, and the best way to learn it is to try it. This drives me to experiment and learn new things by creating projects. That is why this portfolio is just like my data knowledge, constantly evolving and expanding. As I tackle new data challenges, their result gets documented in this portfolio to demonstrate my knowledge and skills gained.  

# About me

Since a very young age, I always enjoyed solving puzzles and engineering things. Back in school, I started learning Python programming language and one of the first projects that I developed, was an algorithm to cipher and decipher texts using Vigen√®re cipher.
My passion led me to choose Forensic Science, majoring in Digital Forensics at the University of Technology Sydney. During my study, I was introduced to data analysis from the perspective of forensic science. I sharpened my Excel and Python skills  as well as learned how to utilize machine learning techniques for forensic data analysis. This gave me a solid foundation in data analysis that I further developed.

## Professional career

In my current role as Assistant Operations Manager at Merivale, I manage our digital ordering platform and point-of-sales system. Through my time in this role, I learned how to utilize the data generated by both systems to make data-driven decisions that make a direct impact on the business. As a part of my responsibilities, I collect, analyze, and present data-driven insights to relevant stakeholders. Based on these insights, I make informative actions that directly impact the business performance. These actions have resulted in a 50% increase in sales on our digital ordering platform and an increase in product upsells through various categories by 10%. Additionally, I proactively develop new data visualizations to provide our venue with unique perspectives on sales data. Collaborating closely with business stakeholders, I continuously improve the visualizations based on their feedback and needs. 

# Projects
### Global retailer sales analysis
**Goal:** To derive key business performance indicators based on the sales history and create appealing visualizations highlighting relevant information for business management.  
  
**Detailed guide:** [Power BI Visualizations project](https://github.com/artembudkin/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Power%20BI%20Data%20Visualization%20Project/README.md)  
  
**Summary:** The company Plant Co. is a hypothetical global plant retailer. The company would like to utilize its data to create a clear dashboard highlighting the business performance for the management team. It provided an Excel workbook containing three datasets. Two of them contained dimensions tables: a customer accounts table and a products table, and one fact table containing sales data.   
As a part of this project, the following skills have been used: 
* Data cleaning  
* Key performance indicators calculation   
* DAX functions  
* Data visualization  
  
**Result:**  The final result is a dashboard containing key performance indicators, and slicers that allow filtering of data by year, gross revenue, quantity of units sold, and sales. The dashboard contains several visualizations comprised of a treemap, waterfall graph, stacked bar chart, and scatter plot highlighting the business performance relative to the previous year to date. The waterfall graph and stacked bar chart allow end-users to drill down to more detailed information based on time to identify performance drivers for those sections.
